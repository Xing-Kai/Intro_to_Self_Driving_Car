    "In the nanodegree, you will see robot probability distributions represented two different ways: \n",
    "* with discrete probability distributions\n",
    "* and with continuous probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "As a preview of what's to come, you will generally use discrete probability distributions when modeling a car or robot's movement on a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see continuous probability distributions when locating objects that are moving around the self-driving car. And sensor measurement uncertainty is generally represented by continuous probability distributions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you are going to work with discrete probability distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to pretend your robot lives in a one-dimensional world. You will get some intuition into representing discrete probabilities on a 1D grid map. Then in the next exercise, you will figure out how to represent a discrete probability distribution on a 2D map grid."

    "Imagine you have a robot living in a 1-D world. The robot lives on a grid with nine different spaces. The robot can only move forwards or backwards. If the robot falls off the grid, it will loop back around to the other side.\n",

    "The robot has a map so that it knows there are only nine spaces. But the robot does not know where it is on the map. Here is the 1-D map. Even though the world is represented by squares, the world is 1-D because the robot can only move forwards to the next square or backwards to the square behind it:\n",

    "The function should store the probabilities in a list.\n",

    "So in the example given so far, there would be a list with nine probabilities. And every value in the list would be 1/9. Remember, because the robot does not know where it is at first, the probability of being in any space is the same."
